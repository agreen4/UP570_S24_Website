    "text": "A very important early task in Neighborhood Analysis is to select the place that you will spend time examining in depth this semester. The place you select will be the location that you focus your social, economic, and demographic analysis on. Given the structure of this class, you need to choose a location in the United States.\nYour work will include thinking about how that place fits within its larger “region.” What do we mean by “place”? It might be a city or town—the City of Champaign—or even twin cities—the cities of Champaign and Urbana. It could also be a county. For our purposes, it is not an entire metropolitan area or a larger macro region (such as the Great Plains or Mississippi Delta)."

    "text": "Place Selection Considerations\n\nBig places—the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York—are interesting. They are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and it is usually not hard to find “stories in the data” with respect to neighborhood trends. However, large cities are very complex. Properly understanding the past, present, and future of such places and their neighborhoods can be a herculean task. Unless you are very familiar with a big place, we suggest focusing on a smaller place.\nMany of the techniques you will learn use methods that draw on data available at the census tract level, as census tracts are frequently used as (imperfect) proxies for neighborhoods. As you work to select your place, it may be useful to identify the number of census tracts that overlap. As a rule of thumb, your place should have no fewer than 15 tracts. More is certainly ok, but let’s talk if you are considering a place with fewer than 15 tracts.\nConsider selecting a place in a broader area of particular policy concern, such as an economically distressed region (central Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, or the Black Belt). Many communities in the Great Plains and Mountain states are not distressed by conventional measures but they face significant out-migration and population decline, which introduce their own challenges at the local level. Places around international borders can also be interesting to examine.\nConsider selecting a place within driving distance of Champaign-Urbana (although you may not select Champaign County or it’s constituent cities as your place). Making a site visit to the county and its principal urban centers could help you understand its conditions and context better, giving you the ability to write about it with more authority.\nHaving some personal experience in the place you select can be helpful. Many students select their hometown or other community/county in which they have lived, provided the criteria above are satisfied. Some students also select places there are interested in living or working in.\nIslands and territories (such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii) and remote areas (such as Alaska) are interesting, but geography and data availability can make them challenging places to analyze. Students have analyzed all of these places in recent years- but with extra effort needed to address data gaps and limitations. You may want to explore these issues before committing to one of these places.\nIf you have any questions about the places you are considering, or you wish to talk through your choices, please talk with me."

Often there are some important local trends (sustained economic distress, rapid economic growth, high rates of international migration, etc.) that provide a good organizing framework for more specific social and demographic trends.\nYou already have most of the data and code you need from class lab sessions. You should plan on drawing from these, but also expanding upon them. Expansion may mean looking at data sources or indicators we have not explored before. We are looking for evidence that you are using the most appropriate information to follow through on your lines of argumentation. What is important is dictated by… your place!\nLikewise, you are not required to include all of the types of tables, graphics, and analyses you produced for the prior exercises. Now is the time to narrow your focus to the most significant local characteristics and trends.\nFeel free to incorporate other material (e.g., existing studies or reports) that will help you provide context for your discussion or help you interpret trends.

In this class, you will contract for a grade based upon your choices regarding your learning process and the amount of effort you want to put in.

Each of you has proven time and time again in other classes that you can reproduce certain expected outcomes. The challenge in this class will focus on assessing your effort and learning process as opposed to the reproduction of outcomes. \nImplementing a contract-based assessment approach mirrors course goals regarding our understanding and practice around the power of data, particularly with regards to public deliberation, decision-making, and governance. Dealing differently with power around evaluation in our classroom mirrors how we might deal differently with power and power relationships in professional practice.\nThere is increasing evidence in higher education settings that unitary grading measures tend to hamper individual learning, and have the potential to be biased towards certain types of students. Put simply, obsessing about grades in advanced coursework is counter-productive to advanced learning. This course adheres to the pedagogy that when given more control and ownership over the terms of evaluation, a student is more likely to embrace the challenges presented to them within the classroom, and are more likely to take ownership of their work (see, for instance Elbow and Inoue).\n\n\nContract Expectation Summary\nEach of you begins the semester with an “A” in the class. You may alter your grade based upon the choices you make regarding the following accountability expectations: \n\n\n\nGrade\nAbsences\nLate\nMissed\nIgnored\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nB\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nC\n4\n2\n1\n1\n\n\nD\n5\n3\n2\n1\n\n\nF\n6\n4\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\nAbsences indicate the number of times you are absent from class. Additional excused absences may be allowed due to documented extenuating circumstances.\nLate Assignments are assignments submitted after a due date but within 48 hours of the due date.\nMissed Assignments are assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date.\nIgnored Assignments are assignments that are not submitted by the last day of class (excluding your final assignment). Ignored assignments are a more serious breach of contract than missed assignments as they reflect contracted work which you have not completed.\n\nPlease note that assessment of these contracted standards are based upon what you do. The contracted grade does assess of the quality of your work. You will reflect upon and will receive direct feedback on the quality of your work as part of the assignment review process. Note that I reserve the right to adjust your grade based upon exceptionally strong or weak engagement within the class. I will provide sufficient feedback over the course of the semester so that your final grade in the class should not be a surprise based upon what you do and how you reflect upon your learning over the course of the semester."

    "text": "Basic Communication Strategies\n\nMemo Format\nMemos are often used by urban planners to share information within their agency or with other planners and local government officials. Memos tend to be concise documents that may contain either requested information for staff or recommendations on how to debate or take action around a particular policy issue. Memos are built around clear and concise writing with a logical structure, clear illustrations and visualizations, proper formatting and spelling.\nMemos start with a heading that includes the name of the memo author, name of the intended recipient, date, and a descriptive subject heading:\nMemorandum\n\nTo: Janet Jacobs, Planning Director\nFrom: Mae Q. Plannington, Planner 1\nDate: January 7, 2023\nSubject: Recommendation on Zoning Change for Holloway Parcel\nA memo is typically written in response to something. The first paragraph of the memo should describe what the memo is responding to, and should summarize what the writer of the memo has done to prepare the response. The first paragraph should also summarize any key findings or recommendations.\nInformation within a memo should be organized in a logical fashion. Section headings with descriptive titles help your audience find particular information more easily.\nGeneral information should be presented first followed by more detailed information. As you support information with evidence, you should follow the same progression of general to specific.\nMemos should conclude with a summary statement that encapsulates the key findings which you have come up with. If you are providing recommendations in your memo, this is also an appropriate place to re-state your recommendations, and provide instructions for how your memo recipient should follow up.\nBecause a memo is designed to be a concise document, you may have important additional information which would be useful to share, but which does not fit within the scope of the memorandum. Such items can be included in an appendix or attachment to the memo, and should be referenced as appropriate within the memo (e.g. “See the attached document for the property surveyor’s description of the Holloway parcel”).\n\n\nShort Report Format\nPresent your analysis in the format of a short report or “data brief.”\n\n\nDo Not Include Title Page\nTitle pages have their place in academic papers and larger, formal technical reports. However, they are inappropriate for memos and short data or policy briefs. Keep it simple.\n\n\nAvoid Headers and Footers in Memos\nRunning footers and headers also have their place for certain types of documents, but not for memos.\n\n\nNo Conclusion Needed\nIn other contexts, you have likely been taught to include both introductions and conclusions as ways to help transition in and out of different sections. The memo format is more direct, and does not require the use of opening and closing paragraphs. State you case and let it go at that.\n\n\nNotes and Citations\n\nUse Notes for Technical Explanations\nFootnotes or endnotes are best for stating brief technical explanations for methods and data. Reports may require a longer methodological appendix, but this is typically not appropriate for a memorandum.\n\n\nUse Notes for Citations\nUse an endnote or footnote to cite sources for memos and report briefs. Bibliographies or “Works Cited” lists are appropriate for longer reports or academic papers.\n\n\nCombine Data Source Citations\nIt makes good sense to use endnotes or footnotes to discuss data used in an analysis in a memo or report brief. But you do not necessarily need to use a separate note for each data source or series. Instead, combine them by introducing one note early in the document. Something like: “The data used in this analysis are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 5-year American Community Survey and 2020 Census Household Pulse Survey”.\n\n\n\nFormatting Considerations for Printing\nIncreasingly, memos and other routine planning communications are communicated digitally, however, it is important to prepare documents that will be legible when printed. In most circumstances, formatting considerations for printing will also apply to documents intended to be communicated digitally.\n\nLeft Justify Text\nUse left justification for text, and not full justification.\n\n\nInclude Page Numbers\nInclude page numbers in the bottom center or bottom right of your page.\n\n\nOne Inch Margins\nUse one inch margins on the left, right, top and bottom, including on all pages with tables and figures.\n\n\nTwelve point font\nUse a twelve point font, preferably something like Times for your text. You can use a ten point font for footnotes and endnotes. No text should be smaller than ten points."

    "section": "Style",
    "text": "Style\n\nAwkward Sentence Construction\nA catch-all category for a painful-to-read but not necessarily grammatically incorrect sentence. Sentence may be an affront to good writing style. Admittedly, professors often put AWK in places where they know something is amiss, but not being writing instructors, they’re not sure technically how to explain what is wrong. Bottom line: the sentence doesn’t work. Proofread yourself and then have someone else read to ensure clarity.\n\n\nWrite Directly\nDon’t mince words: come out and say it. Instead of “The BLS and BEA data show that employment in the microchip industry is very small,” write “Employment in the microchip industry is very small.” Or, instead of “It is very important to note that data disclosure rules preclude reporting employment for all sectors,” write “Data disclosure rules preclude. . .”\n\n\nAvoid Excessive Use of Jargon\nAvoid the planner’s pitfall: too much use of all those fancy planning terms and acronyms. It’s not impressive or erudite, just boring.\n\n\nAvoid Passive Voice\nThe extensive use of passive voice may be the single most common reason why a majority of sane individuals would rather walk on hot coals than read a technical document. Doesn’t “The region’s population growth dramatically outpaced the nation’s over the study period” sound better than “Using population data, it was found that the region grew much faster than the US over the study period”?\nAnother example: replace “A three-part analysis will be conducted in this paper” with “This paper will present a three-part analysis” or “In this paper, I will conduct a three-part analysis.” Reject passivity. Be active.\n\n\nUse Active Headings and Subheadings\nUse headings and subheadings to help organize your findings and discussion. In addition, keep ’em active and efficient. Instead of “Location Quotient Analysis” as a sub-heading, try a short title that conveys findings, e.g., “Region Specialized in Manufacturing and Services.” Headings and subheadings should never extend beyond one line of text.\n\n\nAvoid Unnecessary Equivocation\nSometimes it makes sense to offer caveats or otherwise “hedge your bets” when discussing a finding. However, don’t overdo it. Population growth doesn’t “seem fast.” It either is or is not fast, relative to something else (which you should be comparing it to). A location quotient indicates whether a region is or is not specialized in a given industry; it does not indicate that the region “seems specialized” or “may be specialized.” On the other hand, location quotients do not say much beyond specialization (you would not damn the torpedoes and argue, on the basis of a manufacturing LQ above 1.2, that the region is “highly competitive” in manufacturing).\nIf you find yourself making equivocations, it’s worthwhile to revisit the evidence you’ve provided to make a point to ensure you’re making the strongest argument possible. Communicate that argument confidently, and provide appropriate caveats when necessary.\n\n\nIn Memos, Don’t Stay What You’re Going to Say\nIn academic papers or longer reports it often makes sense to provide a roadmap to the document (e.g., “This report begins by summarizing major trends in population. It then. . .”). The adage that you should “say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you said” doesn’t apply for short policy and analysis pieces. Just get on with the analysis and findings. Strong organization and active headings will help your reader infer how you’ll make your points.\n\n\nPlaces Don’t Have Agency\nIn discussing social, economic, and demographic trends for neighborhoods, cities and regions, avoid implying that places have “agency.” Example:\nEl Paso shifted its population mix in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nIn this case, El Paso as a collective, is being treated as an actor when it is actually simply a place with a collection of actors (people, households, businesses, organizations) who are reacting to the federal policy change in various ways.\nIt would be more accurate to say something like this:\nEl Paso’s population mix shifted in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nThere may be cases when implying the place is an actor makes sense, for instance when you are discussing a community-wide strategy or policy.\n\n\nDiscuss Findings, Not Exhibits\nPeople don’t want to read about figures and tables. They want to read about trends that matter from your analysis. Avoid discussing exhibits. Instead, discuss findings, referring to figures and tables as supporting evidence.\nNo: “Figure 1 shows that poverty in center city neighborhoods in Cleveland is increasing.”\nYes: “Poverty in center city Cleveland is increasing (see Table 1).”"

    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\n\nPrint and Proof\nWe increasingly have an imperative to produce, edit, and disseminate our work using a completely electronic workflow. This has its benefits, but you need to develop a workflow that allows you to edit your draft with diligence. Printing and proofing a document by hand can often catch errors that would otherwise become lost in digital copy - such mistakes often reveal themselves in embarrassingly stark relief once disseminated.\n\n\nDefine Acronyms on First Use\nThe first time you use an acronym (e.g., HUD), spell it out, followed by the acronym in parentheses. “Data are from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).” Then use the acronym to your heart’s content.\n\n\nWrite out Numbers Less than 11\nAlthough sometimes the convention is that numbers one through ninety-nine should be spelled out. Numerals should be used for rates, percentages and other “data” indicators. Thus we would write “there are eight counties in the MSA,” but “the region grew by 8 percent.”\n\n\nSpell out Numbers Starting Sentences\nAny number that begins a sentence (or a bullet point) should be spelled out.\n\n\nWatch Your Capitalization\nNo need to capitalize industries, occupations, or other sectoral-type categories. Do not over-capitalize. Note that when referring to a single county, write “Tehama County.” But writing about multiple counties, it is “Tehama and Shasta counties.” Also: the “City of New York” but the “cities of Palo Alto and San Jose.”\n\n\nNo Apostrophe on Dates\nWhen referring to decades (e.g., 1990s), do not use an apostrophe.\n\n\nData are Plural\nNo: “The data is hard to find.”\nYes: “The data are hard to find.”\n\n\nUse Proper Note Punctuation\nNote numbers are best placed at the end of a sentence outside the punctuation.\nYes: This is a sentence that requires a citation.1\nNo: This is a sentence that requires a citation2.\n\n\nComplete Sentences in Notes\nFootnotes and endnotes should be complete sentences. Complete sentences have punctuation at the end.\n\n\nPunctuation Inside Quotes\nPunctuation generally goes inside quotes.\nYes: “Run, Tom, run,” said Jane.\nNo: “Down, Spot, down”, said Percival, Dick’s little-known cousin from Topeka.\n\n\nWrite out Percent\nOne of the few times the “less ink is better” rule is violated. Write “8 percent,” not “8%.” It’s less distracting to the eye.\n\n\nUse Arabic Numbers for Notes\nMicrosoft Word often defaults to the use of Roman numerals for notes and endnotes (i, ii, iii. . .). Change this option and use Arabic numerals. More efficient.\n\n\nCiting the URL is Not Enough\nIn the Internet age it has become distressingly common practice to cite only the URL for online documents. But consider this: if you quoted Tolstoy’s War and Peace using a copy you checked out from the New York Public Library, you would not cite the library as the source. The same principle applies to the Internet. For web sites, which are inherently Internet-based, you should list the name of the cite and then the URL. For documents accessed online, you should cite in the usual way (author, date, title, etc.) and then include the URL. Note that you are not obligated to list the URL for freestanding documents if you include the complete citation otherwise.\n\n\nAvoid Ampersand (&) in Text\nThe symbol “&”, known as the ampersand, should not be used in your text write-up. It is ok to use it for labels in tables and figures."

    "section": "Numbers",
    "text": "Numbers\n\nInterpret Quantities by Comparison\nDo not just report growth rates, quantities and other indicators for individual places. They are hard to interpret by themselves. For example, to back up a claim that your region has faced substantial population growth in the last decade, contrast its growth rate with the national average growth rate.\n\n\nExplain Regional Geography\nThe first time you mention your region, explain–either in the text or in a note–what its geographic composition is (e.g., its counties).\n\n\nSignificant Digits\nUse numbers with levels of precision that match the realistic precision in the underlying data. Should a location quotient be expressed as 1.709? No. Round to the nearest tenth (1.7). Percentage growth rates for subnational areas are also usually best expressed with one decimal place. Shares can be converted to percentages and expressed to one decimal place to make them more readable.\n\n\nOnly Include Exhibits You Reference in Text\nNo table, figure, chart or line drawing should be included in the report or report appendix unless it is referenced somewhere in the text discussion. That reference may be very brief (“see Table 4”), but it has to be there (it could also be in an endnote or footnote). Think of it this way: if it wasn’t important enough for you to mention it, why did you include it?\n\n\nReport the Quantity\nSometimes it is easy to forget to report the variable levels when we are analyzing variable trends. For example, it is common in analyses of wage trends (“wages are on the up and up”) to find nary a mention of wage levels. As a reader, you are left wondering “wages are going up, but are they high or low?” It is better to ground an analysis of changes in a given variable with a mention of the levels of the variable. So “The current annual average wage in River City for production workers is $27,500. That is up 12 percent in real terms since 1997. By contrast, the average production worker wage nationwide increased by 16.5 percent. . .”\n\n\nEmphasize Significant Findings\nWhen analyzing data we are looking for the most significant findings and often a “story” that helps explain those findings. In descriptive analysis, significance is often first assessed not in a statistical sense, but by looking for high and low values or major changes. But not all high/low values or large changes are necessarily important from a policy or planning point of view. Be careful to think through the potential implications of a finding before discussing it. Ask yourself: “So what?” If you can’t think of an answer, leave it out. (Example: “Since 1990, River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in every quarter except IIQ 1996 and IVQ 1998” might be better stated as “River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in 54 of the last 56 quarters.” A subtle change but the reader is not left asking: “Hmm, I wonder if I’m supposed to know why it was higher in those two periods?”\n\n\nPercent versus Percentage Points\nLet’s say you’re comparing the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.0 percent to the Peoria unemployment rate of 4.0 percent. Is the Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national rate? No. It is 1 percentage point lower. A Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national average would be 4.95 percent.\n\n\nRefer to Exhibits in Text\nRefer to your figures and tables directly in your text. Example: “Table 2 reports employment growth figures for the 1995 to 2003 period.” Or: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (see Table 4).” If you are going to send readers to a table in a parenthetical phrase (like the last example), be sure to include the word “see.” So, you would not write: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (Table 4).”"

    "section": "Tables, Figures and Graphics",
    "text": "Tables, Figures and Graphics\n\nMake ’Em so they Stand Alone\nFigures, graphs and tables should be constructed so that they can stand alone (as much as feasible). That is, someone could pick up and read the table without the accompanying text and get the gist of what it is trying to say. It goes without saying that sources of all data and calculations should be clearly indicated.\n\n\nAvoid Use of Grids in Tables\nThere is almost never any reason to include gridlines on a data table. Putting a line below the column headings and one below the last row of data, followed by the data source, is usually the best approach.\n\n\nDecimal Justify Data Columns\nLine up columns of numbers in tables on their explicit or implicit decimal points. Do not center justify numeric data.\n\n\nUse Descriptive Column Labels in Tables\nRemember the golden rule in table and figure construction: make it stand alone. That means column headings that someone can understand without reading the report body. Sometimes this is hard to do efficiently (headings can get too long). In such cases an alternative is to use short-hand headings but explain what they mean in a footnote to the table.\n\n\nUse Label Hierarchies in Tables\nA good way to make tables more efficient is to use hierarchical labeling of columns. In the table below, employment and payroll data for Illinois were available in 2003. But national and regional data were available only for 2001. The table efficiently reports the 2003 Illinois numbers along with national and Midwest growth rates for 1990-2001 and location quotients for 2001. A note at the bottom of the table should clarify how the Midwest is defined as well as what the reference area is for the location quotient.\n\n\n\nIndicate Source on Figures and Tables\nData sources should be indicated clearly on all figures and tables.\n\n\nUse Detailed Sources\nFor some series simply listing the data provider agency is not enough. For example, BLS reports several employment series. Therefore, list the series within BLS (or other) that you are using. For example, Regional Economic Information System, US Bureau of Economic Analysis, or Covered Wages and Employment, US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\nPie Chart? No Thanks\nWhile seductive to the eye, pie charts are far less interpretable than a simple bar chart. Go for conveying your findings clearly, not spicing up your document with spurious graphical devices.\n\n\nShun 3-D\nThree dimensional bar charts and other graphics generally should be avoided. They usually compromise proper interpretation of the findings. Keep it simple: no 3-D.\n\n\nCall Tables “Tables” and Figures “Figures”\nBy convention, tables are called “tables” and graphics such as data charts or line drawings are called “figures.” Sometimes people use the word “exhibit” to label a line drawing. Avoid use of the terms “chart” and “graphic” for labels (e.g., Chart 1, Graphic 1). Also, never call a table a figure or a figure a table. Note that exhibit labels are generally capitalized: “Population trends for River City are summarized in Table 4.”\n\n\nSequence Tables and Figures in Order in the Text\nIf you have three tables, do not discuss Table 1, then Table 3, then Table 2. If the results in Table 3 are mentioned prior to those in Table 2, renumber the tables. Same for figures or any other exhibit.\n\n\nUse Commas for Numbers\nIn data tables, include commas in the number formatting to denote significant digits. So: $47,500 instead of $47500.\n\n\nAvoid Grids on Figures\nMany graphical packages default settings include gridlines on charts. Most charts are simple enough not to need them to be clearly interpreted. Get rid of the clutter and save some ink!\n\n\nDon’t Rely on Color\nRemember that your best intents for people to view your document in color may be foiled - some individuals may print documents in grayscale, and others may be colorblind and unable to perceive all colors. That means your document should not depend on color to convey its findings. An example of depending on color would be to use red text in your tables to indicate negative values or any color to highlight interesting trends.\n\n\nReport Numbers in 000s\nIt is ok to report very large numbers in thousands or even millions in tables if the precision in the original units is unnecessary. It is probably not critical in most cases for people to know that the US population changed by 1,456,789 over a given period (1.46 million will probably suffice). For small areas, such as counties and regions, reporting the original units is usually preferred except for large number variables (e.g., total dollar income).\n\n\nNo Superfluous Material\nAvoid the practice of tacking on government documents or tables to your reports as “general points of information.” The idea in most professional writing is to convey maximum information with minimum material; tossing in nonessential material from secondary sources defeats that aim."

    "text": "R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis:\n\nFirst, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing.\nSecond, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output.\nThird, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\n\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!"

We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will think about how our analysis of quantitative data fit with other forms of data and engagement to fill in gaps in knowledge.\nBy the end of this course, we will:\n\nBecome familiar with common sources of information used to describe neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics;\nLearn how to use R, RStudio, and Github to create reproducible analysis;\nLearn how to work collaboratively to tell compelling stories for deliberation and decision-making."

    "text": "Course Format and Expectations\nOur focus during class sessions will be on learning by doing. Our class will meet twice per week - Tuesdays will typically be devoted to introducing new strategies and information, and Thursdays will typically be devoted to applying these strategies. Outside of class, you’ll use class resources and video tutorials to learn basic concepts and to prepare to apply these concepts in class.\n\nClass Computing Environment\nUnless otherwise noted, please plan on bringing to class a computer that will run R and RStudio (available for PC/Mac/Linux) and for which you have administrative privileges.\n\n\nWhat to Expect from me\n\nEmail: The easiest way to communicate with me outside of class is via email. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time, it’s okay to nudge me to respond.\nOne-on-one meetings: I am available to speak one on one - you can book an appointment via my Calendly page. Of course, I am happy to chat before or after class if I am available.\nTroubleshooting: Plan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this allows us to build a repository of our problems and responses.\n\n\n\nWhat I Expect From You\n\nBe Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community.\nActively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on individual leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. This class assumes collaboration and sharing as part of our learning model.\nRead with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. Details matter in this class - be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus).\nAct with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work.\nSeek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course but also budgeting time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nUP 570: Neighborhood Analysis is open to students with graduate-level standing. The course assumes that you have previously taken UP 517: Data Science for Planners or have substantial experience with data manipulation in R, particularly using approaches linked to the Tidyverse. Our first few course sessions will focus on ensuring that we are all familiar with basic workflows and methods which we’ll make use of over the course of the semester.\nPlease talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you."

Please notify me in advance of any course sessions which you will miss. Your final grades will be reduced by 1% per unexcused absence.\nFor those students who need to miss class due to a religious observance, please complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances form should any instructors require an absence letter in order to manage the absence. In order to best facilitate planning and communication between students and faculty, I request that students make requests for absence letters as early as possible in the semester in which the request applies.\nFor more information on attendance policy as described in the University of Illinois Student Code, please see Sections 1-501 and 1-502.\n\n\nA Note on AI Tools\nArtificial intelligence tools like Chat GPT have quickly made waves with their ability to produce text, code, and explanations from natural language prompts. I encourage (and at times expect) you to integrate such tools into your problem solving strategies and workflow, especially with regards to coding in our class. These tools must, however, be used with care and with understanding around how they synthesize and produce information. A few words of guidance:\n\nAssume that any code produced will require additional tweaking or troubleshooting to be implemented effectively in your workflow.\nAssume any facts or figures rendered via AI models are incorrect.\nUse these tools to help you break through coding or analysis challenges, not for writing up your narrative or findings.\nWhile you do not need to provide a citation for Chat GPT or other AI tools in your narrative or references, please indicate in any methods statements that these tools were employed. Please also reflect upon your application of these tools in your assignment submission reflections.\n\nThese tools are rapidly evolving. Let’s keep a running dialog about how you’re employing these tools, what some of the challenges are, and how you may want to integrate such technology into your workflows."

According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this course, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss assignments with your peers, all of your analysis, and writing should be your own. The consequence for violating these expectations may include receiving no credit for the assignment in question, and may include automatic failure of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Simple Standard\n\n\n\nPut simply, give credit where credit is due."

That’s a given, and is an expected part of learning in this class. Part of the goal is to teach you how to understand the intentionality and logic behind the software so that you can anticipate where errors are likely to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiential Learning\n\n\n\nThe only way to do this is to encounter errors - and there will be many!\n\n\nYou are entering an intermediate to advanced stage of learning a new language, its grammar, and its application. While this will be frustrating at times, there is a major payoff in the capacity you will gain in analytic skills and problem-solving. This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.\n\nYou are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting. Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.\n\n\nYou got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I promise!\n\n\nWe’re Here For You\nWe’ve been living in particularly abnormal times for the last few years - full stop. It would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur “normally” right now. We continue to teach and learn under emergency circumstances.\nAs you face challenges this semester (and beyond) I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can."
