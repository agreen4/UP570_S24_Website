## Session Description

This session builds upon the work on your last lab. In that lab, you worked on developing several workflows that will support your work over the course of the semester. Coming into this lab, you should have a formatted Quarto markdown document. In this session, we'll talk about strategies for sharing that work, will configure your computer to communicate with GitHub, and will create your first publicly facing websites.

## Before Class

1.  Read through the entire [lab background description](../assignments/labs/02_sharing/02_sharing.qmd) before approaching lab tasks.

2.  Be prepared to access the formatted Quarto notebook you worked on in the last lab that contains your analysis of Chicago community areas.

3.  Be prepared to access your Lab 1 reflection.

Hello everyone - live from class!

## Reflect

1.  How can planners and others engaging directly in public policy discourse and debate leverage emotion in their analysis in ways that generate meaning and connection without manipulating or leading towards particular conclusions?

2.  Is there such thing a "neutral" data analysis?

3.  Can you think of classification systems that may have unintended consequences or biases in data that you've used for urban analysis in the past?
