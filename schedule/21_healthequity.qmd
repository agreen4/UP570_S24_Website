## Reflect

1.  What are some tropes or conventions we use to talk about individual health? Collective health?

2.  How might health disparities (at a neighborhood or population level) be connected to the many themes we've talked about in this class?

3.  Is population health a planning issue? What role do practitioners and researchers in planning have for influencing how we think and act around health at the neighborhood level?
