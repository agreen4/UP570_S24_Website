## Session Description

This week is devoted to working on your your final projects. We will not have a formal class session today - use the time to work on your final project, ask questions of your instructors, or get peer feedback from others in the class.

## Reflect

1.  What's the major story you're telling in your policy memorandum?

2.  Who is the audience for the story? What's the best way to convey your point?

3.  What are the counterarguments or counterfactuals to the evidence that you are sharing. How will you engage with that?

4.  What types of technical issues are you running into that we could help address? Are there any technical concepts or issues that remain unclear that we should engage with or address as a class?
