## Session Description

This will be an independent work session. Andrew will be available during the class session to consult briefly on final projects. Andrew has also opened up additional slots in his Calendly schedule to meet one-on-one.

## Reflect

1.  How does this evidence support the point you're trying to make?

2.  How do you plan to use the evidence in your argument?

3.  What critiques might others have regarding your evidence? How are you planning to preemptively engage these critiques in your analysis?
